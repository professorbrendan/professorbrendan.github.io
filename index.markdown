            <td style="width: 68%;">Click the tabs on the top (<em>About, Puzzles, Research, Teaching</em>) to learn more about specific areas of my work. (Please note that this site, in general, is still being developed!)<br><br> 
                If you're a mathematics educator interested in lesson plans that use current events, news articles, and social media posts to teach quantitative reasoning and mathematics content, check out the <b>Eventmath</b> project!
                <ul>
                    <li>Eventmath is funded by a <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Eventmath">Wikimedia Project Grant</a>.</li>
                    <li>Check out <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Eventmath">the site on Wikiversity</a> and attend one of our <b><a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Eventmath/Meetups/Summer_2022_workshops">live, online workshops August 17, 18, or 19</a></b> to learn more about the project and get started on a lesson plan page of your own!</li>
                    <li>Please share these links with anyone else who might be interested in using current events and social to help students develop authentic, practical skills in mathematical reasoning.</li>
                </ul>
                Finally, the <em>Posts</em> heading below has a chronological list of blog posts (with more to come). <br><br>
